#' TWAS: A package for transcriptome-wide association studies
#'
#' The TWAS package provides a single function, \code{twas}, for
#' jointly modeling two independent data sets: trait data (genome-wide
#' association, GWA) and expression data (transcriptome-wide
#' association, TWA). The analytical goal is to leverage the
#' transcriptome data in analysis of the GWA data to inform the
#' mechanisms underlying gene-trait associations.
